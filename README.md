#  JSON-Q
Simplie CLI program to query a (particular!) json object.

#### About project:
Although I've worked with Node.js, I'd never really got to do any CLI programs, and was excited by the process.  I did some intial research, reading articales, and gather info.  I did my best to componentize my functions.  Many times that was not possible, but with a few tweaks, particulatly the process section could be used for querys of a different sort.



Technologies used:
- Node.js

Dependencies:
- "chalk" - Add some color to output in terminal
- "clear" - Clear the terminal line - styling
- "es6-promise" - Just to be sure we're using es6 promies
- "figlet" - Styling text.. only used for title
- "inquirer" - Used for comman line interface
- "isomorphic-fetch" - my preferred means of HTTP reqeusts, fetch

Setup and usage:
-
